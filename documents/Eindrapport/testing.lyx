\begin_body

\begin_layout Standard
During the development of our library and demonstrational game we used several
 frameworks and tools to assure the quality of the written code and to test
 it properly.
 We also had access to the expertise of the Software Improvement Group (SIG)
 to review our code.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Frameworks
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The used frameworks for testing are essentially Jasmine for Behaviour-Driven
 Development and CoDo for automated code documentation generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Jasmine
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Jasmine is a Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) testing framework for JavaScript.
 It allows the developer to easily convert user-stories to proper BDD test-cases.
 These test cases can then be run from a command-line interface to create
 an easy to read overview of failing and passing tests.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This helped us a lot in debugging functionality that broke older functionality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CoDo
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good code needs to be documented well.
 CoDo specifies a way to write comments in CoffeeScript code that allows
 CoDo to easily extract this meta-information about the code and automatically
 create documentation.
\end_layout

Tools

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Node Inspector
\begin_inset CommandInset label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We made our own Node Inspector in WebGL that shows all nodes in a 3-dimensional
 space.
 This tool has been very handy during debugging Vivaldi and PoPCorn.

JS Coverage
\begin_inset CommandInset label

name "sub:JS-Coverage"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
JS Coverage is a framework that
\begin_inset Quotes eld

instruments
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 JavaScript code to include counting executions of lines of code before
 Jasmine runs the test.
 After running the test, JS Coverage will then read out how often a specific
 line of code was executed and creates easy to read reports about this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately JS Coverage only reports line coverage, which of course does
 not say a lot about code.
 A better framework would've been Istanbul which features a lot more (for
 example branch coverage).
 Unfortunately it turned out to be a lot of work to get Istanbul to work
 with our CoffeeScript code.
 Therefore work on this was abandoned to not spend more time on getting
 the testing framework to work than to actually develop the library and
 game.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
cake
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With cake it is possible to create buildscripts that run on every computer
 independant from settings and operating system.
 This helped us a lot in building the project on regular basis and automatically
 run all tests to ensure the codes quality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
CoffeeLint
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
CoffeeLint checks the code to ensure a coherent style of coding.
 This helps reading the code because it is ensured that code-aspects like
 whitespacing are the same in every file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Sublime
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The text-editor Sublime helped us slightly by keeping the code clean by
 automatically removing unnecessary whitespace at line endings and having
 good syntax highlighting options for CoffeeScript available.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
SIG
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Software Improvement Group evaluates the quality of code by automatic
 and manual analysis.
 For this project we are required to send our code to SIG twice.
 Once halfway of the project and the second time at the end of the project.
 After sending it in the first time we are expected to read the comments
 carefully and adjust the code accordingly so the second feedback points
 out less issues.
 Our first feedback of the SIG can be found in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Software-Improvement-Group-Review-1"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After this first review we followed up on most of the suggestions given
 by SIG.
 We did move the game to its own directory so files of the library and the
 game are no longer in the same directory.
 We also refactored long functions to consist of multiple smaller functions.
 We did not remove the code duplication between the network library and
 the game because eventually these two components will be split up in two
 repositories where the game can only use the public interface of the library
 and the library should never even know about the game.
 Therefore the shared code in these two deliverables cannot be placed in
 a common directory.
